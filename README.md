## Install

```bash
npm install llmparser
```

## Usage

Quick note: this library is meant for server-side usage, as using it in client-side browser code will expose your secret API key. Go [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) to get an OpenAI API key.

```ts
import { LLMParser } from llmparser;

const categories = [
  {
    name: "MSA",
    description: "Master service agreement",
  },
  {
    name: "NDA",
    description: "Non disclosure agreement",
    fields: [
      {
        name: "effective_date",
        description: "effective date or start date", // instruction for LLM
        type: "string"
      },
      {
        name: "company",
        description: "name of the company",
        type: "string"
      },
      {
        name: "counterparty",
        description: "name of the counterparty",
        type: "string"
      }
    ]
  }
]

const parser = new LLMParser({
  categories,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
})

const ndaText = await loadPDFAsText("src/nda.pdf") // get text of PDF
const extraction = await parser.parse(ndaText);
```

Classified as an NDA and extracted 3 fields.
